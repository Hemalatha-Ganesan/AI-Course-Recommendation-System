# 🎓 AI Course Recommendation System (MERN + ML)

## 📌 Project Description

The AI Course Recommendation System is a web-based application that provides **personalized course suggestions** to users based on their interests, skill level, and interaction history.

This project integrates the **MERN stack** with a **Machine Learning recommendation engine** to deliver intelligent course recommendations instead of showing generic course lists to all users.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used

* **Frontend:** React.js
* **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
* **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose
* **ML Service:** Python (Flask / FastAPI)
* **API Communication:** REST APIs (JSON)
